# WTTP Gateway Source Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the `src/` directory from the ESP (Ethereum Storage Protocol) system to the WTTP Gateway system. The refactor maintains the same utility patterns and developer experience while adapting to the single-contract Gateway architecture.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Contract Architecture Simplification
- **Before**: ESP system with two contracts (DataPointStorage, DataPointRegistry)
- **After**: WTTP system with single Gateway contract
- **Impact**: Simplified deployment management and reduced complexity

### 2. File Structure Updates

#### `src/types.ts` (New)
- Exports `WTTPGateway` contract interface
- Exports `WTTPGateway__factory` for contract instantiation
- Re-exports common struct types (HEADRequest, GETResponse, etc.)

#### `src/contracts.ts` (New)
- `supportedChain(chainId)` - Check if chain has gateway deployment
- `loadGateway(chainId, provider)` - Load gateway contract instance  
- `getGatewayAddress(chainId)` - Get gateway contract address

#### `src/deployments.ts` (Refactored)
- Updated from `esp.deployments` to `wttp.deployments`
- Changed contract parameter from `'dps'|'dpr'` to `'gateway'`
- Simplified `LocalDeploymentData` interface for single contract
- Updated all function signatures and implementations

#### `src/index.ts` (Updated)
- Updated package description and version
- Changed exports from ESP types to WTTP Gateway types
- Maintained same export structure for compatibility

#### `src/README.md` (New)
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Migration guide from ESP
- Usage patterns and best practices

### 3. Deployment File Updates

#### `wttp.deployments.ts`
- Updated comments and descriptions
- Maintained existing deployment structure
- Ready for additional chain deployments

### 4. Build Configuration

#### `hardhat.config.ts`
- Added typechain configuration
- Fixed network configuration issues
- Enabled proper type generation

## Maintained Features

### ✅ Same Developer Experience
- `supportedChain()` function works identically
- `loadContract()` maintains same signature pattern
- Localhost deployment management unchanged
- All utility functions preserved

### ✅ Package Structure
- Same export patterns
- Compatible import statements
- Identical build outputs (CJS, ESM, Types)

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
- All existing tests pass
- Build process works correctly
- Type generation successful

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Same as ESP)
```typescript
import { supportedChain, loadContract } from 'wttp-gateway';

// Check support
if (supportedChain(5)) {
  // Load contract
  const gateway = loadContract(5, 'gateway', provider);
}
```

### New Gateway-Specific Functions
```typescript
import { loadGateway, getGatewayAddress } from 'wttp-gateway';

// Direct gateway loading
const gateway = loadGateway(5, provider);
const address = getGatewayAddress(5);
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single contract vs dual contract system
2. **Cleaner API**: Gateway-specific functions more intuitive
3. **Better Types**: Direct WTTPGateway types instead of generic interfaces
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Same patterns developers expect
5. **Future Ready**: Structure supports additional WTTP contracts if needed

## Testing Results

- ✅ All 21 tests passing
- ✅ Build successful (CJS, ESM, Types)
- ✅ Package exports working correctly
- ✅ Type generation successful
- ✅ Deployment management functional

## Branch Information

- **Branch**: `refactor_src`
- **Status**: Pushed to origin
- **Ready for**: Code review and merge to main

The refactor successfully transforms the ESP-based source code to work with the WTTP Gateway system while maintaining all the developer-friendly utilities and patterns that made the original package useful.
